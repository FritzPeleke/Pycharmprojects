* Data for the cancer project can be gotten from the kaggle link:
[https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection)
1. The CancerCNN.py gets you above 90% accuracy
2. The CancerResnet.py builds you a Resnet-18 from scratch and gets you above 80% accuracy.
## CIFAR-10 subproject
* This project is one of the datasets which come with keras and a more challenging dataset than the simple MNIST.
